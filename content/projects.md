#### Fall 2020: Ionic hybrid app for iOS and Android (Angular & TypeScript)

This student project was done as a four-member team for a company studying the viability of using the [Ionic framework](https://ionicframework.com/) for their mobile development. The app was an Ionic/Angular frontend connecting to an existing PHP backend. I mainly focused on interpreting the API documentation and getting the HTTP requests working in development and on mobile. I also created some of the actual views/pages in the app, some with multistage forms including validation. The company categorically required a NDA for the project.

#### Spring 2020: Visim physics (Wordpress & PHP)

I was part of five-member team creating a new Wordpress site for [Visim physics](https://visimphysics.com/). Visim creates and sells instructional videos for physics exercises and demonstrations to schools. The site included a secured area where customers with login can access the exercises and videos served from Vimeo. The project used various Wordpress plugins but also required some custom PHP to enable the needed functionality.
