### About me

I'm an IT student in the process of transitioning to a new career in software development.

### Studies

Currently I'm studying a 210 ECTS Bachelor of Business Administration degree at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences with a focus on information technology. In the past I've also studied industrial engineering and management, and information processing science at the University of Oulu.

### Skills and interests

I've had a keen interest in computers ever since our family got our first Atari. Over the years I've dabbled in some small scale programming projects but I never was that focused in it. I've had some previous exposure to PHP, C, C++ and Java and this has allowed me to keep a certain programming point of view in mind.

Recently I've started my studies and begun to focus on web development as part of my degree courses but also by studying and participating in open university courses provided by University of Helsinki. These include for example:

* [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/)
* [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/)
* [Web application development](https://web-palvelinohjelmointi-20.mooc.fi/) (in Finnish)
